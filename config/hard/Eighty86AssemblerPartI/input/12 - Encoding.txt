16
; Tricky encoding explanation
;
; 65535 = 0xFFFF (unsigned)
; -1 = 0xFFFF (16-bit signed)
; Two different numbers are encoded the same way
;   depending on the range considered (signed or unsigned).
; When executed, instructions will interpret the immediate as
;   signed, unsigned, or both (ADD/CMP/...).
; MOV example
mov ax, 65535
mov ax, -1
; ADD example
; As 65535 = 0xFFFF = -1 and -1 = 0xFF for 8 bits,
;   the command is assembled with R16, I8:  83 C0+T data
; 0xFF will be sign-extended to 0xFFFF when executed.
add ax, 65535
