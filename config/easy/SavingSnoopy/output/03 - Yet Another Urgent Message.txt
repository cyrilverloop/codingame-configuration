One last security measure has been added to our encoding scheme that must
be included in your decoding rules. Upon observing a percent sign, the
recently observed characters need to be shuffled. To shuffle the
characters, start with the oldest character (furthest to the left in the
list) and add every 2nd character until the end of the list. Then add the
2nd oldest character and add every 2nd character until the end of the list.
Assume the list of recently observed characters to be a, b, c, d, e, f, g
where g is the most recently observed character and f is the 2nd most
recently observed character. The new shuffled list would be a, c, e, g, b,
d, f.
