Enemy forces are moving west and we are concerned Snoopy's position has
been compromised. In order to beef up security, an additional rule has been
added to the decoding rules. Upon observing a hash tag, a certain number of
characters should be deleted from the list of most recently observed
characters (that have not yet been used). Immediately after the hash tag
will be a single digit integer between 1 and 9 indicating how many of the
most recently observed characters should be deleted. (hash tag)1 means
delete the first most recently observed character. (hash tag)2 means delete
the two most recently observed characters.
